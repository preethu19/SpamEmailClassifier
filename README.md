## Overview
This is a Flask web app which detects whether a E-Mail is spam or not spam.

## Motivation
This project is done as a part of Pie Infocomm Machine Learning with Python internship under the guidance of Aishwarya Saxena.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7.3. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
